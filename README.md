A text-mode game developed in C language as final project for the Computer Programming I subject.

In this game, the player has to read the story that is told and, based on that, make decisions (via text). All of these decisions are relevant to the story.
When the game starts, it randomly generates one of two possible playable characters, with different initial values for their stats. The stats are: Health, Money and Affection. If one of them comes to 0, the game is over. The game objective is to make the best decisions as possible for the playable character to get through all that's presented in the story.
